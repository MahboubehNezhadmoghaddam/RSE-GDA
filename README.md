# RSE-GDA
Official implementation of the Riesz s-Energy based Gradient Descent Algorithm (RSE-GDA)  for optimal Î¼-point distribution on linear, concave, and convex manifolds.  This code accompanies the paper "Approximating Optimal \mu-point Distributions over a Generalized Sphere for Riesz s-energy using a Gradient Descent Algorithm"
